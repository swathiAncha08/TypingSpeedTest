# ⌨️ Typing Speed Test Web Application

An interactive **Typing Speed Test Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that measures typing speed (WPM), accuracy, and time taken.

This project demonstrates real-time text comparison, timer functionality, and dynamic performance calculation.

## 🎨 UI Overview

- Smooth blue-purple gradient background
- Centered card layout
- Display area for reference text
- Text input area for typing
- "Start" and "Submit" buttons
- Live statistics display:
  - ⏱ Time
  - 🚀 Words Per Minute (WPM)
  - 🎯 Accuracy %

---

## 🚀 Features

✔ Start button to begin test  
✔ Timer functionality  
✔ Real-time typing input  
✔ WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation  
✔ Accuracy percentage calculation  
✔ Submit button to show final results  
✔ Clean and responsive UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Gradient + Flexbox layout)  
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. User clicks **Start**.
2. Timer begins counting.
3. A reference sentence is displayed.
4. User types in the input box.
5. On clicking **Submit**:
   - Total time is calculated.
   - Words per minute (WPM) is calculated.
   - Accuracy is calculated by comparing typed text with original text.
6. Results are displayed dynamically.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **WPM Formula:**
  ```
  WPM = (Total Words Typed / Time in Minutes)
  ```

- **Accuracy Formula:**
  ```
  Accuracy = (Correct Characters / Total Characters Typed) × 100
  ```
